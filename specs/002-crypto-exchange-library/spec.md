# Feature Specification: Crypto Exchange Library

**Feature Branch**: `002-crypto-exchange-library`
**Created**: 2025-09-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "я хочу реализовать, библиотеку, это библиотека предоставляет возможность выбора одной из крипто-бирж, например Binance или Bybit, я их взял для примера, и также выбора различных опций торговли, выбора инструментов и т.д. которые предоставляют api этих бирж"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using this library, I want to easily connect to different cryptocurrency exchanges (like Binance or Bybit), access various trading instruments, and execute trades, so that I can build my own trading applications without writing exchange-specific code for each one.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** a developer has valid API keys for Binance,
    **When** they initialize the library with the exchange set to "Binance" and their credentials,
    **Then** the library should successfully connect to the Binance API.

2.  **Given** the library is connected to an exchange,
    **When** the developer requests the latest price for the "BTC/USDT" trading pair,
    **Then** the library should return the current ticker price for BTC/USDT.

3.  **Given** the library is connected to an exchange and the user has sufficient funds,
    **When** the developer places a market buy order for 0.01 BTC on the "BTC/USDT" pair,
    **Then** the library should execute the order and return a confirmation with the order details.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when invalid API keys are provided? The library should return a clear authentication error.
- How does the system handle an exchange being down or unreachable? The library should throw a connection error after a reasonable number of retries.
- What happens if a user tries to trade an instrument that doesn't exist on the selected exchange? The library should return an "instrument not found" error.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a unified interface to connect to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST initially support Binance and Bybit exchanges.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow for fetching available trading instruments (pairs) from the connected exchange.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide functions to get real-time market data (e.g., ticker price, order book) for a specified instrument.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow users to place, cancel, and query the status of orders (e.g., market, limit).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST securely manage user API credentials (API key and secret).
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide clear and consistent error handling for API failures, network issues, and invalid parameters.
- **FR-008**: The design MUST be extensible to allow adding new exchanges in the future with minimal code changes, using an abstract base class for the exchange adapter.

### Key Entities
- **ExchangeAdapter**: An interface or base class that defines the common methods for all exchange integrations (e.g., `connect`, `get_ticker`, `place_order`).
- **BinanceAdapter**: A concrete implementation of the `ExchangeAdapter` for the Binance exchange.
- **BybitAdapter**: A concrete implementation of the `ExchangeAdapter` for the Bybit exchange.
- **Credentials**: A data structure to hold API key and secret.
- **Instrument**: Represents a trading pair with a base and quote currency (e.g., BTC/USDT).
- **Order**: Represents a trading order with properties like instrument, type (market/limit), side (buy/sell), amount, and price.
